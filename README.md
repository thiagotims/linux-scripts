## iac-basics
This script is part of the first challenge of the Bootcamp Linux Experience, promoted by Dio and taught by instructor Denilson Bonatti.

### Challenge Description:
In this project we will create a script where the entire infrastructure of users, user groups, directories and permissions will be created automatically. The script file will be uploaded to GitHub for future reuse of the script. Therefore, any new virtual machine that starts is already ready for use when the script runs.
